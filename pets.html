                <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them. <p>
                <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

                <p>Meet Murphy! He was my second dog and lived to age 13. He was the happiest puppy who always wanted to be as close to his family as possible (awwww!!!!). He loved to swim and had THE MOST enthusiasm! He prefers to spend his entire day swimming and running the field Up North. </p>
                <P>He had many crazy adventures during his lifetime from coming face to face with a Bull that escaped a farm up north to chasing ducks to the middle of the lake. He was a very brave puppy!</P>
